# Processor scheduling algorithm in C

# About the project:
This project is my second assignment for the FIT2100 (Operating Systems) unit. This project contains the following:
- processor_scheduling.c, processor_scheduling.h, 26445549.c (main function)
  - C implementation of FCFS (First-Come-First-Served), Round Robin, and SRT (Shortest Remaining Time) processor scheduling algorithm
- processes1.txt, processes2.txt
  - Input files that contain the process ID, arrival time (in seconds), and total processing time (in seconds) in a table structure
- Comparison of FCFS, RR, and SRT performance
- makefile for building the C program
- User documentation for the C program
